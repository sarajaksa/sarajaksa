### Hello

My name is Sara Jak≈°a and I live in Ljubljana. At work I am a software developer at [LeanIX](https://www.leanix.net). I spent the last couple of years working on the third-party integrations and some backend, and am now switching to the frontend development. 

You can find more about me on my website [https://sarajaksa.eu](https://sarajaksa.eu). For my past presentations and cv you can go to my [CV page](https://sarajaksa.eu/cv).

You can contact me through email [sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu](mailto:sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu). I have the list of other services that I am using and I am not using on the main page of my website. Feel free to reach up for any reason.
